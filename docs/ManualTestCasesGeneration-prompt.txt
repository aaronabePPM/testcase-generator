Given an Azure DevOps work item ID, do the following steps and produce a CSV of manual test cases that can be imported using the provided template.

Prerequisites:
Check if Azure CLI is installed. If not installed, install Azure CLI before proceeding with the export command.

Export the work item JSON (PowerShell):
Run this command in PowerShell (replace <AZDO_ID> with the work item number). Do NOT include a Project argument.
Use the current workspace folder for all file operations.
az boards work-item show --id <AZDO_ID> --organization "https://dev.azure.com/hexagonPPMCOL" --output json > "PBI-<AZDO_ID>.json"

Example (for ID 5152532):
az boards work-item show --id 5152532 --organization "https://dev.azure.com/hexagonPPMCOL" --output json > "PBI-5152532.json"

Create the test cases CSV:
Read the JSON file exported above from PBI-<AZDO_ID>.json in the current workspace.
Pay special attention to the DeveloperNotes field — it outlines the developer's work and must be covered by the test cases.
Use the CSV file testcase_template.csv in the same folder as the authoritative template for header/column layout. The output must follow that exact header/column order and layout.
Output file: Testcases_PBI_<AZDO_ID>.csv in the current workspace folder
Constraints and formatting rules (strict):

Do not include the Project argument in the az command.
Do not add ID, Area Path, or State columns to the CSV.
Test Case Titles must NOT contain the PBI/Bug number. Titles must start with the type prefix (examples): FUNC-XX, VAL-XX, UI-XX, NEG-XX, REG-XX — pick the right prefix per test.
Keep Test Case rows and Test Step rows on separate lines: never put Test Case-level values (Work Item Type, Title, etc.) on the same row as step-level values.
This is a CSV import: do not include commas anywhere inside any text fields. (Commas are CSV separators and will break import.)
Ensure you create manual test cases covering Functional, Validation, UI, Negative, and Regression scenarios as applicable to the work described.
Include clear preconditions, steps, and expected results for each step. Keep steps concise and avoid commas.
Map each test case to the relevant features/requirements described in the JSON (use the fields: Title, Description, Acceptance Criteria, and DeveloperNotes).
Create a reasonable number of test steps — enough to reproduce the scenario and verify success/failure.
Use plain text only in the CSV (no markup). No extra lines before or after content.
Deliverable:

A CSV file Testcases_PBI_<AZDO_ID>.csv placed in the current workspace folder that follows testcase_template.csv exactly and contains the new test cases derived from the JSON file.
Reminder:

REMINDER: Never place Test Case values (Work Item Type or Title) on the same row as Test Step values — keep Test Case rows and Test Step rows on separate lines to avoid import/formatting errors.
REMINDER: This is a CSV file, so do not include commas in any text fields.
