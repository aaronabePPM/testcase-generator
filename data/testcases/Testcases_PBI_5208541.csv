Work Item Type,Title,Test Step,Step Action,Step Expected,Expected Results
Test Case,FUNC-01: Custom Workflow Creation,,,, 
, ,1,Create a custom workflow with Reject (on Submit) and Revoke (After Close) transitions,Workflow created successfully with specified transitions,
, ,2,Configure Reject transition to go to Origin state,Transition configuration saved successfully,
, ,3,Configure Revoke transition to go to Origin state,Transition configuration saved successfully,
Test Case,FUNC-02: Workflow Corruption Test,,,, 
, ,1,Trigger a situation that would cause the workflow to become corrupted (e.g., simultaneous updates),Workflow corruption occurs; error message displayed
, ,2,Verify that the workflow becomes misaligned,Workflow misalignment prevents next user from updating status,
Test Case,FUNC-03: Workflow Realignment,,,, 
, ,1,Identify and resolve the cause of the workflow corruption,Workflow realigned successfully,
, ,2,Verify that the workflow is updated correctly,Workflow updated correctly; next user can update status,
Test Case,FUNC-04: Deployment Workflow Update,,,, 
, ,1,Deploy the updated workflow model,Workflow model updated successfully on deployment,
, ,2,Verify that the updated workflow is applied correctly,Updated workflow applied correctly; no issues observed,
Test Case,VAL-01: Workflow Validation,,,, 
, ,1,Create a custom workflow with invalid transitions (e.g., Reject to a non-existent state),Workflow creation fails; error message displayed
, ,2,Verify that the workflow validation prevents invalid configurations,Workflow validation prevents invalid configurations,
Test Case,NEG-01: Workflow Corruption Error Handling,,,, 
, ,1,Trigger a situation that would cause the workflow to become corrupted,Error message displayed; workflow corruption prevented,
, ,2,Verify that the system handles the workflow corruption error correctly,System handles workflow corruption error correctly,
Test Case,REG-01: Existing Workflow Functionality,,,, 
, ,1,Verify that existing workflow functionality is unaffected by the custom workflow creation,Existing workflow functionality unaffected,
, ,2,Test existing workflow transitions and configurations,Existing workflow transitions and configurations work as expected,
Test Case,REG-02: Workflow Update Regression,,,,
